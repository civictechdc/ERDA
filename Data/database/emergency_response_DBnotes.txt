NOTE ON emergency_response.sqlite Database - 
Here is a relational database of the emergency response data we recieved. It is intended as a star schema. I figured there are five dimensions to our data. Unique instances, locations, dates and dispatch times, responses times, and unit types. The dim_unique table is populated with all of the supposed unique instances. dim_location is all of the unique locations. dim_unit is the emergency vehicle types. dim_date is all of the dispatch times and incident dates. dim_response is all of the response times. fact is then the all of the unique instances, their report ids and the id's the they correspond to in the dimmension tables.
